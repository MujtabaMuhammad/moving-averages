# Moving Averages on S&P 500 ðŸ“ˆ

This project analyzes S&P 500 stock data from 1927 to 2020 to evaluate the effectiveness of two widely used technical indicators: the **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** and the **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**. The analysis focuses on generating buy/sell signals, comparing SMA vs. EMA performance, and identifying which may serve better for long- vs. short-term investment strategies.

### Objectives
- Analyze daily returns of the S&P 500 index
- Calculate and visualize 20-day SMA and EMA
- Generate and evaluate buy/sell signals based on trend crossovers
- Explore indicator strengths and limitations in predicting market behavior

### Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Excel** (for initial data handling)

### Dataset
S&P 500 historical data sourced from Nasdaq:

### Summary of Findings
- **SMA** performs better for **long-term investment strategies**
- **EMA** is more responsive and suitable for **short-term trading**
- Both indicators are lagging and work best when used with other tools (e.g., RSI, MACD)
- Seasonal trends and trend reversals can provide added context when interpreting moving averages
